Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you're working with other people or on multiple different machines. Or if you're trying to show off your work and you want to show it at a central, online location

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
