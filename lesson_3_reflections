Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you're working with other people or on multiple different machines. Or if you're trying to show off your work and you want to show it at a central, online location

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Some updates you might not be interested in or they might interfere with a project that you're working on

q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks are "clones" of another users branch but by utilizing them you still give them credit, but they are just a clone that will not affect the orginal users branch(es)
