Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you're working with other people or on multiple different machines. Or if you're trying to show off your work and you want to show it at a central, online location

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Some updates you might not be interested in or they might interfere with a project that you're working on

q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks are "clones" of another users branch but by utilizing them you still give them credit, but they are just a clone that will not affect the orginal users branch(es)

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: You can see any changes that have been made with the update or any potential conflicts

q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A: Send through email or some other file sharing system. It would be much more difficult to manage multiple people wokring on the same file since updating files would be much more tedious.

q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

a: when you're collaborating with other people and you want to make a change and be sure that it isn't conflicting with other people.
